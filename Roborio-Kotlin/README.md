Reset Robotics 2019

This repo contains all our code for our 2019 robot, Orthus. 100% of the robot code (excluding vision and LEDs; both being run on separate co-processors) is in Kotlin.

This project utilizes the [Sertain](https://github.com/sertain/sertain) library for a majority of the library functionality that would otherwise be provided by WPILib.
